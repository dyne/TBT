= Adding audio to your typing =

This adds audio playback for several of the different keystrokes.
Replace the files with your own audio-samples.

Syncing works great with Chromium, in Firefox not entirely but still effective.

= Callback =

Also can use a callback to execute a new command after the tbt-file is finished:

Example:

var tbt = new TBT();
tbt.startTyping("textDestination", TimeBasedText, function(){
    alert("hello there");
});
